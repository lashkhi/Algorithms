Here is some of warmup problems:

#1) Diagonal Difference
Given a square matrix of size N×N, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line containing N space-separated integers describing the columns.

Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.


#2)Plus Minus
Given an array of integers, calculate which fraction of the elements are positive, negative, and zeroes, respectively. Print the decimal value of each fraction.

Input Format

The first line, N, is the size of the array. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array of numbers (A1,A2,A3,⋯,AN
A1, A2, A3, ... AN).

Output Format

Print each value on its own line with the fraction of positive numbers first, negative numbers second, and zeroes third.

#3)Staircase
Your teacher has given you the task of drawing a staircase structure. Being an expert programmer, you decided to make a program to draw it for you instead. Given the required height, can you print a staircase as shown in the example?

Input 
You are given an integer N depicting the height of the staircase.

Output 
Print a staircase of height N that consists of # symbols and spaces. For example for N=6, here's a staircase of that height:
     #
